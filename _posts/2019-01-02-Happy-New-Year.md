title: Happy New Year!

I am still getting this started, and trying to determine what I would like to work on first.

My favorite part of the web is to design the website, which is pretty overwhelming when you can do anything. This theme may stick around for a while as I explore my options on my test server. Not sure how crazy I will get.

My goal this year is to explore my own personal creativity in the midst of doing work for my day job and clients. It is easy to get lost in work, so 2019 will be a refreshing year.

Do you have a goal for 2019?
