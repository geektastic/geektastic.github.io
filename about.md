### "Visions are worth fighting for. Why spend your life making someone else's dreams?" (from the film *Ed Wood*)

I am a Brand Manager by trade, with over 20+ years of experience in graphic and web design. I grew up with the Internet, chipping away at HTML in Netscape Composer and IE Frontpage. We have come a long way from the 90s.

I am currently re-exploring design and creating in as many mediums as possible. This site will log my explorations, whether in analogue or digital.
